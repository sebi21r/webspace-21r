                    Here there will be some Tutorials, beginning with 
                    Minecraft all the way to (maybe) Web-Dev.

                    Here I will give Tutorials about Minecraft Commmands, so
                    that, everyone that is interestet, the topic is easier
                    to understand.

                <h1>What I want to achhieve with this?</h1>
                <p>
                    I mainly want to achieve, that as many people 
                    as possible have access to ressources and information,
                    that they need, to create, whatever they wish.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Of course, I can't make a Tutorial on everything
                    and of course, I can't go into the smallest details,
                    but hopefully, with my help, others can get the necessary
                    information, in combination with information from other sources,
                    that they need, to create incredible Projects and have fun.
