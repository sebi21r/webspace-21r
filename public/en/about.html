                    I'm sebi, but you can just call me sebi...

                    I'm the webmaster of this site and hope you have an extrordinary stay at my site!
                    I mainly created this website, becuase I don't really want to post anything on social Media,
                    because it's too much attention for me. When I saw Neocities for the first time, I thought that
                    this is a great place. Thanks to my earlier experience with Web-Development I have decided to also
                    create a Website, on which I will share different Projects and Tutorials. Neocities just felt like
                    a quieter place, where I can upload my shenanigans.

                    Directly conflicting with what I just wrote, I will be trying to maybe create a Youtube Channel.
                    But I will, at least for the Beginning, only upload Minecraft videos and I'm not even
                    sure if I will keep a constant upload schedule.

                    I mostly just do Software stuff, like WebDev, Python and a smaaaaaaaall little bit of Java(cause Mc Modding) and, 
                    of course, I am very interested in Minecraft Mapmaking. Though, if I'm honest with you, I didn't ever
                    really finish a Project. I usually just stop in the middle of it.
