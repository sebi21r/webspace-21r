                    hi. I'm currently in the final stage before I move
                    this site out of my OneDrive and onto github. That means
                    that I think all I have left to do is to finish some text
                    and maybe prepare stuff for the release?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways. As I was saying the Website in its current state
                    is (almost) ready for the World of Github. I've been working
                    on this site on and off for the last few months and I saw, that 
                    I had a previous entry here (which was mainly just a placeholder)
                    that was from early december 2024!! crazy that I was working on
                    this site for so long!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually my first plan was to release it to github and
                    neocities at the same time, but I thought that I just neeeeed
                    to get this site off of my OneDrive. Not because of storage (I have enough thanks to our school account),
                    but rather because I don't want to have to log into my Microsoft
                    account everywhere and then start VSCode just to see the Website.
                    It's wayyy easier on Github. Sooo, I better get to it!
                </p>

                    This Website is just for fun and to document 
                    various Projects, Tutorials and other stuff.
