                    hi. I'm currently in the final stage before I move
                    this site out of my OneDrive and onto github. That means
                    that I think all I have left to do is to finish some text
                    and maybe prepare stuff for the release?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways. As I was saying the Website in its current state
                    is (almost) ready for the World of Github. I've been working
                    on this site on and off for the last few months and I saw, that 
                    I had a previous entry here (which was mainly just a placeholder)
                    that was from early december 2024!! crazy that I was working on
                    this site for so long!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually my first plan was to release it to github and
                    neocities at the same time, but I thought that I just neeeeed
                    to get this site off of my OneDrive. Not because of storage (I have enough thanks to our school account),
                    but rather because I don't want to have to log into my Microsoft
                    account everywhere and then start VSCode just to see the Website.
                    It's wayyy easier on Github. Sooo, I better get to it!
                </p>
                
            
            </div>
            <div class="text box-shadow" id="27/9/25">
                <p class="small-text">27/9/2025</p>
                
                <p>
                    "final stage" amiright?! haha...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did it! A little later than expected, but whatever. At least its done and I can finally be free of the hand of OneDrive.
                    Github is a way better solution! I will link the tutorial I used to move my website to github.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So uh.... I am uploading veeeery irregularly. Just kind of how I feel like it, but I would never abandon this site. I hope
                    to update the site more often, but only time can tell how regular and often this site will be updated. The plan for right now
                    is to make new tutorials (and Shrines!) and then upload and show them to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And my Website now actually has a name! Webspace 2(1r). It's obviously a reference to my name sebi21r.
                    It also fits with the style of this site! We're in spaaaace!

                    Hello! This is the November upd- wait it's december already?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may have noticed, that I delayed the november update to december. Why?
                    well qutie simply because I had a lot to do (and still have) and didn't have enough time for the update. PLUS
                    i just couldn't get the enter buttons right and i'm still not satisfied with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the website now has a new landing page, where the english and deutsch buttons are smaller and now just
                    change the language and you enter the website by clicking on enter or betreten
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other changes are just fixing mistakes, just like in october. The picture of the month is also the november 
                    picture, since this update is meant to come out in november.
                </p>

                    Happy new year everyone!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this year I hope to continue updating the website so regularly.
                    At least as regularly as I can. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of Update. I have added one site to this website:
                    <br>
                    <a href="/en/photo-archive.html">The photo archive</a> is an archive for the pictures of the month.
                    (and maybe more, who knows)
                </p>
                <p>
                    There have also been changes to the text in the landing and home pages as well as
                    a new to do list so I can keep track of my to do's for this site. There is also a new
                    picture for january, of course.
                </p>

                    This Website is just for fun and to document 
                    various Projects, Tutorials and other stuff.
